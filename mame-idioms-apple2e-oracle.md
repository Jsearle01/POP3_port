# MAME idioms & quirks — Apple IIe target (the Karateka oracle)

**Purpose:** a standing, self-contained reference so instrumentation quirks on the
`apple2e` target (the `karateka_dissasembly_claude` oracle) are **looked up, not
rediscovered each dispatch.** Every entry is traced to the pass that established it and,
where one exists, to the **harness tool** that exercises it and the **exact command/Lua
syntax** that works. Read this before instrumenting the oracle.

**Target:** `mame apple2e`, Karateka disk (`.dsk`/`.woz`), 6502 CPU, ~1.023 MHz.
**Run cwd:** MAME runs from the **oracle repo** (`karateka_dissasembly_claude`); `-script
tools/foo.lua` resolves **relative to that cwd**, not the tracked repo — see §11.
**Authority reminder:** the oracle is verified-authoritative **through scene 4 only**; past
that, running-game **execution** is the sole authority (labels are hypotheses). None of the
idioms below override that — they are *how* to get reliable execution evidence, which is
exactly what the past-scene-4 discipline requires.

> This file **incorporates** the earlier `mame-idioms-addendum.md` items B and C (arm-before-
> boot watchpoints; boot-time-static bytes) and D (pixel-colour provenance), plus the
> debugger/Lua discoveries from the `$6540` dispatch-closure pass (2026-07-11).

## 0. POP ORACLE MOUNT — **VERIFIED FOR POP, 2026-07-25** (the one section the banner does NOT cover)

Everything else in this file remains inherited-unverified for POP (see the banner). **This section is
POP-verified against POP's own oracle**, on a live run Jay gated "looks good" (2026-07-25).

**The working command** (operator live-watch; Jay's 25.3 gate):
```bash
mame apple2e -sl7 cffa202 -hard1 <abs-path>/PrinceOfPersia_3.5.hdv -window -nomax -prescale 3
```
Confirmed clean: exit 0, 99.89% speed over a 190 s operator run. The image hashed
`c4f0b13e49b77dd0fbc5063e27e53a24` (the Phase 0 Linux reference) at run time.

- **`a2cffa02.zip` in the rompath is a HARD PREREQUISITE.** The CFFA2 card carries its own device
  firmware (`cffa20ee02.bin`). Without it MAME dies before boot with
  `cffa20ee02.bin NOT FOUND (tried in a2cffa02 apple2e)` / `Fatal error: Required files are missing`.
  Verify with `mame -verifyroms a2cffa02` → `romset a2cffa02 is good`. A stock MAME install does **not**
  ship it.
- **⚠ `hard1` does NOT exist on a bare `apple2e`.** `mame -listmedia apple2e` alone reports only
  `flop1`/`flop2`/`cass` — the hard-disk instance materializes **only once a CFFA2 card occupies a slot**.
  Enumerate with the card inserted or the conclusion is wrong:
  `mame apple2e -sl7 cffa202 -listmedia` → `harddisk1 (hard1) .chd .hd .hdv .2mg .hdi`.
- **Slot choice:** `sl7` (the conventional Apple II hard-disk slot) leaves `sl6`'s `diskiing` Disk II
  intact. `sl2` also yields `hard1`; slots are `sl1`–`sl7`.
- **`cffa202` (6502 firmware), not `cffa2`** (65C02, needs an enhanced //e or better) — confirmed by
  the slot-option descriptions.
- **NOT `-flop1`.** Karateka's `-flop1 <dsk>` mount is the wrong media class for POP; the oracle is an
  800K 3.5" ProDOS volume on `hard1`. `.hdv` is natively accepted — no conversion, no CHD.
- **Every other `apple2e` storage card was ROM-blocked in this install** (checked exhaustively per §2A.4,
  via `-listslots` + a run-test on each): `cffa2`→`cffa20eec02.bin`, `a2sd`→`appleiisd.bin`,
  `corvus`→`a4.7.u10`, `focusdrive`→`focusrom.bin`, `zipdrive`→`zip drive - rom.bin`; `booti` exposes no
  `hard1` at all. So `cffa202` + `a2cffa02.zip` is not merely the preferred path, it was the only one.
- **Fallback that needs no extra ROM:** the same build's 5.25" pair boots on the built-in Disk II —
  `mame apple2e -flop1 PrinceOfPersia_5.25_SideA.nib -flop2 PrinceOfPersia_5.25_SideB.nib`. Useful when
  the CFFA2 firmware is unavailable, but note those two `.nib` images are the artifacts that **mismatch**
  the Phase 0 reference md5s (the `.hdv` matches) — so they are not the graded oracle.

### 0a. **`-state` and `-autoboot_script` DO NOT COMPOSE** — the script silently never runs (P4.26)

**Measured, and it is a silent no-op rather than an error.** With `-state princess` present the Lua
autoboot script **does not run at all**: no log file, nothing on stderr, **exit 0**. The identical command
with the `-state` argument removed runs the same script fine and installs every tap.

```bash
#  DEAD — script never executes, exit 0, no diagnostic
mame apple2e -sl7 cffa202 -hard1 <hdv> -state_directory build/oracle_states -state princess \
     -video none -sound none -nothrottle -seconds_to_run 6 -autoboot_script tools/probe.lua
#  WORKS
mame apple2e -sl7 cffa202 -hard1 <hdv> \
     -video none -sound none -nothrottle -seconds_to_run 6 -autoboot_script tools/probe.lua
```

**Why it matters here:** `oracle_scene.lua` writes save states precisely so a later dispatch can skip the
~45 s boot, and the obvious way to use one is `-state <name>` plus an instrument. **That combination
produces an empty log, which reads exactly like "the thing I was measuring never happened."**

**The working alternatives**, in order of preference:
1. **Boot and arm on the oracle's own marker** — `~45 s` emulated is **~4 s of wall clock at 1200-1400%**
   headless, so the save state buys very little. `harness/tools/oracle_pstand_lead.lua` does this.
2. Load the state from *inside* Lua (`manager.machine:load("princess")`) if the boot cost ever matters.

**★ AND ARM ON THE WRITE, NOT ON THE VALUE.** `oracle_scene.lua`'s own `demo` entry records why: a
value-wait fired at frame 8 on uninitialised RAM that happened to hold the right number and reported PASS
from a machine that had not finished booting. Its `princess` entry still waits on a *value* (`SPEED == 12`);
a `install_write_tap` on the same address costs the same and cannot do that.

*Established:* P4.26. Tool: `harness/tools/oracle_pstand_lead.lua`.

**Idiom worth reusing beyond this target: validate a mount headlessly before handing an operator a window.**
```bash
mame apple2e -sl7 cffa202 -hard1 <hdv> -video none -sound none -nothrottle -seconds_to_run 5
```
Exit 0 ⇒ the mount is good. This costs seconds and is what turned "a dead window Jay stares at" into a
precise missing-ROM diagnosis. A missing device ROM is a *fatal-before-boot* error, so it is invisible to
any check that only inspects the media path.

- **A windowed run did NOT write the .hdv back** (measured 2026-07-28): a 137 s operator run at
  100.00% speed left the image `c4f0b13e49b77dd0fbc5063e27e53a24` — byte-identical to the Phase 0
  reference. So the CFFA2 `.hdv` mount does **not** behave like the coco3 side's JVC `.dsk`, which MAME
  saves back unbidden (coco3 idiom 24). Note the limit of this evidence: one run through the intro did
  not write. It is not proof the image is never written — a run that reached a point where the game
  writes could still do so — so a scratch copy remains cheap insurance rather than dead weight, and the
  reference hash is worth checking after any run that matters.
- **Validate the mount headlessly before opening a window**, every time (the idiom below). Re-confirmed
  2026-07-28: 5 s, exit 0, seconds of cost.

*Established:* POP P1.1 oracle build + the 2026-07-25 operator run (Jay gate: "looks good");
write-back and re-validation measured 2026-07-28.

## 1. The load-bearing one: **6502 opcode-fetch bypasses read-taps**

**A scripted read-tap on an execution address silently never fires.** The 6502's opcode
fetches bypass the program-space read-tap that works on the 6809 side. A tap that "should"
fire on a routine's address returns **zero hits** — and zero hits reads as "the code never
ran" when it actually ran fine. **This is a hazard, not a finding. Empty ≠ absent.**

**Fixes, in order of preference:**
- **Watch the data, not the routine.** To confirm a routine ran, watch the **ZP byte it
  writes** evolve (a write-tap / watchpoint on the *result*), not a read-tap on the *code*.
  (How the LCG was confirmed: the `$A000`/`$A0A2` read-tap false-0'd; watching seed `$59`
  evolve was the reliable signal.) → corollary `watch-the-seed-not-the-rng-tap`.
- **Debugger breakpoint** at the instruction — fires on execution, reads registers/ZP at
  the break (§4). This is the reliable execution-point detector on 6502.
- **Write-tap** on a ZP location the code writes (works headless — §2).
- **Time-sweep + PC-verify** (run to a frame, check `cpu.state["CURPC"].value`).

*Established:* scene-6 full-fight (LCG `$59`/`$29` control model); reinforced in the `$6540`
attribution retrieval. **Contrast:** on coco3/6809 **read-taps DO work** — this hazard is
Apple-only (see the coco3 file §10).

---

## 1a. Soft switches toggle on **READS** — a write-only tap reports "no mode switching" (VERIFIED FOR POP, 2026-07-25)

**§1's opcode-fetch false-0 does NOT extend to I/O data reads.** A `install_read_tap` over
`$C000-$C0FF` fires correctly and abundantly (247,989 hits across a 120 s POP title run). §1's hazard
is scoped to **read-taps on CODE addresses** used to detect execution; a soft-switch access is a
**data** access and taps fine. Do not skip a read-tap here on the strength of §1.

**This matters because Apple II soft switches flip on ANY access, and POP uses reads for the
mode-critical ones:**
```
UNPACK.S SETDHIRES     bit HIRESon / bit DHIRESon / bit DHIRESoff …   <- BIT = read
SUBS.S   PAGEFLIP      lda $c05e / lda $c05f                          <- LDA = read
MISC.S / SUBS.S        lda $c057 / lda $c050 / lda $c055              <- LDA = read
```
A **write-only** tap on `$C05E/$C05F` therefore logs **nothing** and reads as "POP never switches
graphics mode" — which is the exact opposite of the truth. Tap **read AND write**:
```lua
_G._rtap = mem:install_read_tap (0xC000,0xC0FF,"ss_r",function(o,d) log("R",o) return d end)
_G._wtap = mem:install_write_tap(0xC000,0xC0FF,"ss_w",function(o,d) log("W",o) return d end)
```
(Keep both in `_G` — §2 GC gotcha.) **Always carry a self-test**: the title sequence certainly touches
`TEXT`/`HIRES`/`PAGE2`, so a zero hit-count means the METHOD failed, not that the game is static.
Log a running hit counter from a frame notifier and check it before trusting any null.

**Noise filter:** `$C000`/`$C001` **reads** are the keyboard, not 80STORE — drop reads of those two or
the log is swamped. `$C002-$C005` (RAMRD/RAMWRT) fire tens of thousands of times per minute from the
aux-memory blitter and drown everything; filter them out unless paging is the question.

**Mapping a PC to a source line:** the P1.1 build leaves `oracle/source/obj/*.LST` listings with
`ADDR: bytes  line  source` — `grep -iE '^ *<addr>' obj/*.LST` resolves any traced PC to its exact
vendored-source line. This is what makes source↔trace reconciliation byte-exact rather than inferred.

*Established:* PA.1 title-mode recon (2026-07-25) — trace PCs `$ECCC-$ECE1` matched UNPACK.S:644-653
instruction-for-instruction.

---

## 1b. `-verifyroms` / `rompath` are **cwd-relative** — a wrong cwd reads as "ROM missing"

`rompath` defaults to the relative `roms`, resolved from **MAME's working directory**. Running
`/c/mame/mame -verifyroms a2cffa02` from a project directory reports:
```
romset "a2cffa02" not found!
```
while the identical command run from `/c/mame` reports `romset a2cffa02 is good`. **The ROM was
present the whole time.** This nearly caused a dispatch to declare its oracle half blocked on a
missing environment prerequisite. Always `cd` to the MAME install (or pass an absolute `-rompath`)
before concluding a ROM is absent — the same cwd-sensitivity §11 records for `-script`/
`-autoboot_script` paths applies to ROM lookup.

*Established:* PA.1 §0(a).3 (2026-07-25).

---

## 2. Taps: install late, keep the return **referenced**, work **headless**

- **Read-taps work only if installed *after* boot transients settle** (not at `t=0`) — e.g.
  after the first ~2000 frames for attract instrumentation, or it silently no-ops.
- **GC GOTCHA (bit me repeatedly):** `install_read_tap`/`install_write_tap` **and**
  `emu.add_machine_frame_notifier` return an object you **must keep referenced** or it is
  garbage-collected and **silently stops firing** — you get an empty log that reads as "the
  game never writes that / the loop never runs." Keep it in a global:
  ```lua
  _G._tap = mem:install_write_tap(0x59,0x59,"seed",cb)   -- read/write tap
  _G._n   = emu.add_machine_frame_notifier(function() ... end)  -- frame notifier — SAME gotcha
  ```
  (The `$6540` pass lost several runs to an un-referenced frame notifier before this.)
- **Write-taps work HEADLESS** (no `-debug`) — they are a memory-system API, not the
  debugger. Cleanest runtime draw-program capture: tap the sprite-src ZP (`$04` hi set last
  before the blit), read the other draw args + clock + `scr:frame_number()` in the callback.
- **Draw order differs per sprite** (some set src-then-pos, some pos-then-src) — a position
  read at the src-write may be stale; cross-check by tapping the position byte too.
- **Preferred for PC/controller/position:** native interactive `wpset` (§4) — it fires where
  scripted taps false-0.

*Established:* standing MAME-instrumentation note; GC gotcha re-confirmed for frame notifiers
in the `$6540` pass. Tool: `harness/tools/scene6_full_descriptor.lua` (the `_G._tap_*` /
`_G._n` pattern).

---

## 3. The attract loop is **non-deterministic run-to-run** — but **seed-deterministic**

Two facts that sound contradictory and are both true:
- **Run-to-run the attract fight VARIES** — a single trace window is **one sample of a
  distribution, not the truth.** Do not treat one fight window as "the fight."
- **It is LCG-seed-driven, so deterministic *from a fixed seed*.** A fixed boot repeats the
  seed sequence → repeats the fight **byte-identical**. Run-to-run variance is **seed
  variance** (interactive entry advances the seed differently).

**Consequences:**
- **Identical runs prove nothing about determinism.** N identical fixed-boot runs is equally
  consistent with "PRNG replayed from a fixed seed" *and* "no RNG at all." **Prove
  stochasticity by perturbing the seed** (poke `$59`), not by counting identical runs.
  Completeness of an animation search = **union-plateau over varied seeds** (a seed-sweep to
  saturation), not repeated boots.
- **Determinism is phase-dependent.** The pre-fight intro (climb/walk/guard-approach) is
  deterministic (traced byte-identical ×2); the **fight past guard-entry is not.** Establish
  the boundary; don't assume the whole loop is one or the other.
- **A sweep axis can silently no-op.** Poking a value the game overwrites (or an ineffective
  seed poke) yields identical fights that *look* like a plateau. **Verify an axis actually
  varies the output before trusting saturation** (the first scene-6 seed-sweep was 8
  byte-identical no-op runs).

*Candidates:* `deterministic-from-fixed-seed-is-not-non-stochastic`,
`verify-a-sweep-axis-actually-varies-before-trusting-a-plateau`. *Established:* scene-6
full-fight multitrack + exhaustive animation search. Tool:
`harness/tools/scene6_full_descriptor.lua` (`FD_SEEDPOKE` at `FD_POKEF`).

---

## 4. The debugger toolkit (the big one) — headless breakpoints, forcing, and capture

This is the reliable route on 6502 (read-taps false-0, §1). Almost all of this was nailed
down in the `$6540` dispatch-closure pass; the exact working syntax is below.

### 4a. `-debug` launches **PAUSED** — and **headless it HANGS** unless you unpause from Lua
`mame apple2e -debug …` opens the debugger **halted at the first instruction**. Interactive,
you set watchpoints then `go` (§4b). **Headless (`-video none`), it just hangs → 0-byte
output.** Unpause from the autoboot script at load:
```lua
pcall(function() manager.machine.debugger.execution_state = "run" end)
```
Without this line a `-debug` headless run produces an empty file and looks like a silent
failure. *Established:* `$6540` pass (repeated 0-byte runs until the unpause was added).

### 4b. Arm `wpset` **before** releasing boot — catch boot-time writes
To catch a byte written **once during disk load** (before runtime code), arm the watchpoint
while paused, then `go`:
```
wpset bffd,1,w        # addr, length(bytes), access(w=write / r / rw)
wplist                # verify armed
go                    # release; breaks when it fires
```
`wpset`/`bpset` syntax varies slightly across MAME versions — if it errors, `help wpset`.
The `addr,length,access` form is stable across many versions but not guaranteed.
*Established:* the `$BFFD-$BFFF` sync-byte experiment (Q010).

### 4c. Breakpoint / watchpoint from **Lua** (headless), with actions
```lua
local cpu = manager.machine.devices[":maincpu"]
-- breakpoint: bpset(addr, condition|nil, action_string)
cpu.debug:bpset(0x6540, nil, 'tracelog "<<<D A=%02X 2F=%02X 20=%02X>>>",a,b@0x2f,b@0x20; go')
-- watchpoint: wpset(space, "r|w|rw", addr, len, condition|nil, action_string)
cpu.debug:wpset(cpu.spaces["program"], "w", 0x20, 1, nil,
                'tracelog "<<<W20 pc=%04X val=%02X>>>",pc,b@0x20; go')
```
**Expression syntax inside actions/conditions:** registers `a x y s pc` (and `curpc`);
byte read `b@0xADDR`; word `w@0xADDR`; **poke byte** `pb@0xADDR=val`; set a register by
assignment `a=0xD1`. Read/**write** a register from plain Lua too:
`cpu.state["A"].value = 0xD1`, `cpu.state["CURPC"].value`.

### 4d. **Force** a value the game overwrites (`FD_STATEFORCE`, generalized to registers)
A read-tap can't override (opcode-fetch bypass); a **bp at the read** can. Override the
register/ZP at the exact read, then continue:
```lua
-- force AI prob-table row $33 at the AI read $A03D (state the demo never selects):
cpu.debug:bpset(0xA03D, nil, string.format("pb@0x33=0x%X; go", ROW))
-- force the action code A (and clear a gate $2F) at a dispatcher entry, to observe a branch:
cpu.debug:bpset(0x6540, nil, 'a=0xC2; b@0x2f=0x01; tracelog "<<<F A=%02X 2F=%02X>>>",a,b@0x2f; go')
```
This is the key to **win-suppressed / unreachable content**: forcing `$33` revealed the
entire losing outcome (player-lose / guard-win cels); forcing A at `$6540` observed the
`$C2→$66FE` branch the player-always-wins demo never fires. *Candidate:*
`debugger-bp-force-to-exercise-a-value-the-game-overwrites`. Tool:
`harness/tools/scene6_dispatch_trace.lua` (`DT_FORCEA`/`DT_FORCE2F`),
`scene6_full_descriptor.lua` (`FD_STATEFORCE`).

### 4e. Capturing per-fire values — **printf is NOT captured headless; use trace + `tracelog`**
Debugger `printf` writes to the **debugger console**, which is **not** on stdout headless —
a bp-action `printf` produces nothing capturable. Instead open a **trace file** and
`tracelog` into it:
```lua
local dbg = manager.machine.debugger
dbg:command("trace C:/…/out.tr,0")            -- traces the full instruction stream of cpu 0
-- per-line register append on the trace (BRACES REQUIRED here):
dbg:command('trace C:/…/out.tr,0,,{tracelog " ;20=%02X 2F=%02X",b@0x20,b@0x2f}')
dbg:command("trace off")                       -- stop
```
**The brace gotcha (cost real time):** a **bp-action** `tracelog` must be **brace-FREE**
(`tracelog "…",a; go`); the **trace-command** action must be **BRACED** (`{tracelog "…",a}`).
Mixing them fails silently. `manager.machine.debugger:command(str)` runs **any** debugger
command from Lua — the general escape hatch. The full instruction trace shows the **branch
actually taken** at a dispatcher: after the bp mark, the executed `cmp/bne/jmp` sequence is
right there — grep the PC region. Add `,noloop` to skip repeated loops.

*Candidate:* `mame-debug-launches-paused-arm-watchpoints-before-go`. *Established:* Q010
(4a/4b) + `$6540` dispatch closure (4a/4c/4d/4e), commit `634e0c3`.

### 4f. Isolate the DECISIVE write with `wpdata`; read the caller via `sp` — but beware JMP-stale returns
Two idioms from the scene-6 walk-window (guard-entry trigger) investigation:

- **`wpdata` conditions a watchpoint on the value being written**, so you can catch only
  the *one* write that matters instead of every write to a hot ZP byte. To find the write
  that first drives guard-pos `$72` below its parked `$30`:
  ```lua
  cpu.debug:wpset(cpu.spaces["program"],"w",0x72,1,"wpdata<0x30",
    'tracelog "ENTRY pc=%04X data=%02X\\n",pc,wpdata; go')
  ```
  The first `ENTRY` line's `pc` is the decisive routine. (A plain `wpset` on a byte touched
  by a block-copy + a scroll-dec + a wrap-inc gives 3+ PCs of noise; `wpdata<K` cuts to the one.)

- **Read the caller's return address off the 6502 stack** in a bp-action tracelog with the
  register token **`sp`** (lowercase; the state key is `SP` but expressions want `sp`).
  After JSR, the pushed return addr is at `$0101+sp` (lo) / `$0102+sp` (hi):
  ```lua
  cpu.debug:bpset(0xB30F,nil,'tracelog "ret lo=%02X hi=%02X\\n",b@(0x101+sp),b@(0x102+sp); go')
  ```
  **GOTCHA (cost a run):** this only works if the routine was entered by **JSR**. If it was
  reached by **JMP** (or fall-through), the top-of-stack is a *stale* return from some earlier
  JSR and points somewhere unrelated (here it pointed at a `jmp`-table vector `$1903`). **Verify
  the entry kind first:** grep the full trace for the instruction line immediately *before* the
  routine's first line (`grep -B1 "^B30F:"`) — if it's `jmp $b30f`, the stack read is bogus;
  the real caller is the branch just above that `jmp`, which you then `dasm` to read the compare.

*Established:* scene-6 walk-window investigation 2026-07-12 (guard entry = player `$62 > $0F`
at `$B29D cmp #$0f` → `jmp $b30f` scroll; decisive write `$B357 dec $72`).

---

## 5. Boot-time-static bytes — written once from disk load, never by runtime code
Some bytes are **set once from the disk image at load time and never refreshed.** A grep of
`src/` for an instruction that writes them finds **nothing** — because no runtime instruction
does. "No instruction writes `$XXXX`" is **not** proof the value is dynamic/protected — it
can be static-from-load. **How to tell:** a write-watchpoint armed **before boot** (§4b)
fires **at boot** (during load), not in the attract/runtime loop → static-from-disk.
(The `$BFFD-$BFFF` EOR-sync bytes `$00/$3B/$49` were static-from-load, which resolved whether
they were copy-protection.) *Candidate:*
`boot-time-static-bytes-arent-written-by-runtime-code`. *Established:* Q010.

---

## 6. `-nothrottle` snapshots **lie for motion**; `-seconds_to_run` is **emulated** seconds
- `-nothrottle` is **fine for ZP-poll traces** (full trace fast). But **`-nothrottle`
  still-frame snapshots manufacture phantom motion artifacts** — a mid-frame no-throttle grab
  ≠ the live rendered frame. Colour/position from a snapshot is not authoritative regardless
  (§10, visual = Jay).
- **`-seconds_to_run N` is EMULATED seconds, not wall-clock.** Under a working `-nothrottle`,
  real time is a small fraction of it. If a `-nothrottle` run drags for minutes real-time,
  **throttle is not actually in effect** — fix the invocation, don't wait it out. Write trace
  output via `io.open` inside the Lua; **`print()` to MAME's console is NOT captured** by a
  stdout redirect.

*Established:* the nothrottle/motion caveat + `mame-trace-window-scoping`.

---

## 7. To see what a scene draws: instrument the **draw entry**, and tap **every** entry
Watch the blit/draw entry (capturing its arguments) — not the frame buffer, not source
labels. **The draw jmptable has multiple entries** (scene 6: `$1903` draw-A / `$1906`
draw-A Y-offset / `$1909` draw-B mirror / `$190C` draw-B Y-offset). **Tapping only the first
silently hides an actor** (the guard drew via `$190C`; a `$1903`-only tap nearly produced a
false "no guard"). **Tap EVERY entry**; where a dispatch fans out, capture at the fork.
Capture the **full per-draw descriptor** at the entry: source ptr, dims, X (`$05·7+$10`),
Y (`$06`), blend/flip (`$0F`), **draw-order index**, **per-frame co-occurrence** — all fall
out of the same tap. *Candidates:* `tap-every-draw-entry-not-just-the-first`,
`y-offset-entry-draws-the-second-tile`, `facing-lives-in-the-draw-entry-not-the-sprite`
(facing = which entry mirrors, not a cel attribute). Tool:
`harness/tools/scene6_full_descriptor.lua` (ENT map, per-draw CSV).

**7b. Static-vs-dynamic facing = the per-cel `entry=[…]` map — but read it via the UNSHARED cel.**
To answer "does an actor flip facing across the scene," the descriptor tool's per-cel
`entry=[A:n By:m …]` aggregate is the direct readout — a single-entry cel never flips; a both-entries
cel *might*. **The trap:** two fixed-facing actors that **share** a cel bank make that cel show BOTH
entries (player draws it draw-A on the left, guard draw-B on the right) — which looks like flipping
but isn't. **Discriminate with each actor's UNSHARED identity cel (the head):** one head per fighter,
never shared, so its `entry` map IS that fighter's facing with no ambiguity. (Scene-6 guard: head
`$8ECB` = `By` only across f6487–8382; player head `$8E9B` = `A` only — neither flips → STATIC;
shared combat bodies show both entries only because the two fixed-facing fighters reuse them mirrored.)
Confirm the shared-cel reading by X: the draw-A instances cluster LEFT, the draw-B RIGHT. **The
trampoline read-taps at `$1903/$1906/$1909/$190C` DO fire** (1507× over a fight window) — this is a
JMP-trampoline entry, not a §1 routine-body false-0. *Candidate:*
`mirror-head-norm-half-is-the-actor-discriminator` (extended: read any per-actor property — facing,
flip, state — off the UNSHARED cel; a shared cel aggregates it across every reuser). *Established:*
scene-6 guard-facing sizing (`docs/project/scene6-guard-facing-sizing.md`).

## 8. Trace **THROUGH** a boundary, not **TO** it; size the run correctly
"Located the transition" ≠ "captured through it." A window capped early (at f7400) hid the
**entire late fight + victory pose** — never in the window, which read as "the poses don't
exist." **Capture through the boundary** (guard-entry → loop-back f9443 → into the Broderbund
title) and **report frame-accountability**: first captured, last captured, every un-captured
stretch. A pose missing from a **covered** stretch is a finding; from an **un-covered**
stretch it's a truncated trace.
- **Sizing gotcha (measured):** the attract runs at **~56 fps** (not 60). To reach frame F,
  `-seconds_to_run ≈ F/56` **rounded up + margin**; undersizing means the run never reaches
  your arm frame → 0-byte output that looks like a script failure. (`$6540` pass: 128 s
  reached only ~7168 frames, missing the f7240 arm; 150 s reached it.)

*Candidate:* `trace-through-a-boundary-not-to-it`. *Established:* scene-6 full-span combat
search. Tool: `harness/tools/scene6_full_descriptor.lua` (`FD_FSTART`/`FD_FEND`).

### 8a. Timing: **MAME frame == one VBL**; the game's vbl-sync count is the (compute-bound) loop rate
For animation/timing traces, the **display VBL timebase is the MAME frame** — one vblank per
emulated NTSC frame, so `frame_number` (or the frame-notifier count) IS the VBL count. **Do NOT
use the game's own vbl-sync routine as the VBL count** — the Karateka fight calls `vbl_sync`
($779A: `lda $C019`/`bmi` on RDVBL bit7) only ~230× over a 960-VBL fight, because the main loop
is **compute-bound at ~14 Hz** (heavy 6502 work per frame) and double-buffers (~2 vbl-syncs per
figure redraw). So: **display-VBL dwell** (frame_number gaps) = the transferable, on-screen
timing; **vbl-sync count** = the game's internal loop tick. Measure pose dwell as VBL gaps
between figure redraws (per combatant, keyed on the head cel), `$20` read at the draw as data.
*Candidate:* `measure-dwell-against-display-vbl-not-compute-bound-loop`. *Established:* scene-6
fight-timing pass. Tool: `harness/tools/scene6_pose_timing.lua`. (Cross-cutting — the display-VBL
= emulator-frame identity holds on coco3 too.)

## 9. Enumeration / filter traps (bite in MAME traces)
- **Low-draw-count ≠ absent.** A cel drawn once and persisting (Mt-Fuji peak `$A948`, 2× at
  entry; the STATIC guard; the eagle one-shot at `$3B=16`) drops off a count-sorted list.
  **Sort by position/Y as well as count; report low-count cels.** → `low-draw-count-not-absent`.
- **Wholesale bank exclusion hides actors sharing the bank.** The climb actor lives in the
  `$A400` bank alongside scroll/cliff; a `$A400-$ACFF` wholesale exclude hid it. **Exclude by
  the sub-range the trace reveals** (EXLO=`$A64A` kept the climb chain). →
  `actor-and-scenery-share-a-bank`.
- **A span on one draw stream can't see a layer in another.** ΔX on the `$1903` blit stream
  missed the fixed backdrop drawn via the `$0A00` fill. **Classify layers across all draw
  paths.** → `span-on-one-stream-cant-see-a-layer-in-another`.
- **X-scope overpaint counts, not Y-band.** A Y-band count blends regimes (Fuji peak
  overpaint 0 vs base 94). Scope to the element's actual (X,Y). →
  `overpaint-count-needs-x-scoping-not-just-y-band`.

*Established:* scene-6 climb / background re-verify / Fuji resolve. Tool:
`harness/tools/scene6_bg_layers.lua`, `scene6_full_descriptor.lua`.

## 10. Visual authority is **Jay's live MAME**, never a Clyde snapshot
Every colour / position / motion / on-screen claim is **Jay's** to gate off a live MAME run
(or his reference snaps). A `wpset` PC-confirm establishes *that code ran*, not *what it
looks like*. The eye is also the tie-breaker when a trace and the on-screen result seem to
conflict (the Fuji "does it scroll" question) — don't overrule the visual with a partial
trace; report the gap. 25.3 = Jay's MAME observation.

**Pixel-colour provenance (the concrete tell — addendum D).** Files labelled
"TRUE"/"reference"/"ground truth" were tool renders, not MAME captures, and were used as
ground truth for multiple iterations (tool-vs-tool, never tool-vs-MAME).
- **The tell is the pixel colour:** MAME blue ≈ **`(25,144,255)`** vs the tool constant
  **`(0,0,255)`** (confirmed present in `harness/tools/palette_derive.py`). A "ground truth"
  file containing `(0,0,255)` is a **tool render**, not a MAME capture.
- **Filename labels establish nothing** — content + creation method + timestamp do. Spot-check
  pixel colour; check the file timestamp against the claimed capture session; check whether
  `sprite_render_apple2.py` produced it.
- **Authoritative captures:** `C:\karateka-capture\snap\apple2e\` — snaps 0082-0085,
  560×192 px, **snap 0083 = record of record**. Derive rules against those.
- **Automated-check tautology:** "109/109 pixels match the rule" is tautological if the rule
  generated the predictions. Validate against **independently-grounded** raw pixel coords from
  the MAME snap. *Candidates:* `tool-render-is-not-a-mame-capture-verify-by-pixel-colour`,
  `automated-check-tautology-validate-against-ground-truth-not-rule-predictions`.

*Established:* standing; sharpened in scene-6 background/Fuji; provenance trap from Content
Wave 1 (commit `0b5825b`).

## 10a. Reference-frame capture — frame-anchored `screen:snapshot()`, seed/ptr self-verified
Building a **visual reference set** from the running oracle (to gate the port's later stages, the
role snap 0083 played for the logo):
- **Apple II AUTO-BOOTS the disk** — unlike coco3 (which needs `natkeyboard:post` LOADM/EXEC, coco3
  file §1/§2), `mame apple2e -flop1 karateka.dsk` boots straight in and plays the ATTRACT.
  No input driving needed; just run and capture at frames.
- **⚠ ZERO KEYBOARD INPUT — a focused `-window` run LEAKS host keys into the emulation (2026-07-13).**
  `apple2e.cfg` has the natural keyboard enabled; ANY keystroke after intro-start makes Karateka
  **disk-load into the ACTUAL GAME** (not the attract). A windowed snapshot run therefore silently
  jumps to real gameplay while a **headless (`-video none`) run stays in the attract** — same frames,
  different scene (verified: f5670–5990 = fight windowed / climb headless). **Capture snapshots
  headless** (`-video none` + `screen:snapshot()`, which reads the screen-device bitmap without a
  window) or disable the natural keyboard. This bug mislabeled the entire scene-6 "climb" set below.
- **Capture mechanism:** a frame-notifier + `manager.machine.screens:at(1):snapshot()` fired at the
  target frames. Snapshots write to **`<-snapshot_directory>/<system-shortname>/NNNN.png`** (MAME
  appends the system dir, e.g. `_raw/apple2e/0000.png`, auto-incrementing in capture order) — so set
  `-snapshot_directory` to a staging dir and **rename/move afterward** to the final tree/convention.
- **Frame-BOUNDARY snapshot avoids the `-nothrottle` mid-frame caveat (§6):** the notifier callback
  fires between frames, so `screen:snapshot()` grabs the last *complete* frame even under
  `-nothrottle` — the motion-artifact caveat is about mid-frame grabs, not this. (~1200% speed for a
  ~140-emulated-second arc.)
- **Anchor to SEED-DETERMINISTIC frames from the recon timeline, not wall-clock** (attract is
  seed-non-deterministic run-to-run, §3; the pre-fight intro is deterministic so its frame markers
  are stable). **Log the frame + `$59` (LCG seed) + the `$03/$04` draw-ptr at each shot** → the set
  is reproducible AND **self-verifying without reading the PNGs**: the ptr confirms the beat. PNG
  *fidelity* stays Jay's visual gate (§10); the log establishes *which beat* each frame is.
  **⚠ CORRECTION (2026-07-13):** the earlier claim that `$A3E9`/`$A4F2`/`$A3C5–$A649` are "climb"
  cels was WRONG — those (and `$838C`, `$59` ACTIVE) are the **actual-game FIGHT**, reached only
  because the windowed capture leaked a key (see the ZERO-KEYBOARD note above). The real attract
  **climb** (Jay visual gate on clean keyboard-off captures) = the hero crawling up then holding
  on the **`$8ACB` figure at row y124** over `$AA`/`$AB` cliff scenery, my-boot ~f6068–6408 —
  AFTER a princess-fall (`$96`/`$99`, still scene-5) and an `$A3E9`/`$A4CC` transition. **Climb
  and fight SHARE banks (`$A4`/`$AA`/`$AB`/`$8Axx`); bank signatures do NOT separate them — only
  the visual gate on a CLEAN (keyboard-off) capture does.**
- **NB `.dsk` vs `.woz`:** the repo oracle disk is `dumps/karateka.dsk` (what all traces use); if a
  dispatch names `Karateka.woz`, use the repo disk and flag it.

*Candidate:* `anchor-oracle-reference-captures-to-seed-deterministic-frames-and-self-verify-with-the-draw-ptr`.
*Established:* scene-6 oracle reference capture (20 frames → `C:\karateka-capture\snap\coco3\scene6\`,
climb/summit/after, `capture.log` manifest). Tool: `tools/scene6_oracle_capture.lua` (transient in
the oracle repo; canonical pattern here).

## 11. Quick command idioms (apple2e)
```bash
# Fast headless trace (no watching) — full trace fast; NOT for motion snapshots (§6):
mame apple2e -rompath <roms> -flop1 <disk> -nothrottle -video none -sound none \
     -seconds_to_run <N> -script tools/<lua>.lua -window -nomax
# Headless DEBUGGER run (bpset/wpset/trace from Lua) — add -debug AND unpause in Lua (§4a):
mame apple2e ... -debug -script tools/<lua>.lua        # lua sets execution_state="run"
# Operator live-watch (Jay's gate): -speed 8 -prescale 3 -resolution 1920x1152 -window -nomax
#   (viewing-only; does not touch cadence. -nothrottle for max host speed.)
# Reference-frame capture (§10a): auto-boots; snapshot at frame-boundary target frames.
#   ⚠ HEADLESS ONLY — `-video none`, NO `-window`. A focused window leaks host keys → the disk
#   loads the ACTUAL GAME and the "attract" capture is silently wrong (§10a ZERO-KEYBOARD note).
#   screen:snapshot() reads the screen-device bitmap without a window, so it still writes PNGs.
mame apple2e -rompath <roms> -flop1 dumps/karateka.dsk -snapshot_directory <stage>/_raw \
     -nothrottle -video none -sound none -seconds_to_run <N> -script tools/scene6_oracle_capture.lua
#   -> writes <stage>/_raw/apple2e/NNNN.png (rename after); log frame+$59+ptr per shot.
```
- **Windows-path-in-Lua gotcha:** `"C:\k…"` is an **invalid Lua escape** — a bad path
  **silently fails the script**; MAME then runs the full `-seconds_to_run` with **no tap and
  no error**. Use **forward slashes** (`C:/…`) or `\\`.
- **Script must be at MAME's cwd:** `-script tools/foo.lua` resolves from the **oracle repo**
  cwd. A tool authored in the tracked repo must be **copied to the run repo's `tools/`** (a
  "file not found → fatal" if not). Keep the canonical copy in `harness/tools/`.
- **`-seconds_to_run` is emulated seconds** (§6/§8); size to `frame/56` + margin.
- **Interactive `wpset`** is preferred for PC/controller/position (fires where scripted taps
  false-0).

---

## 10b. Enumerate a draw program by watching the cel-pointer write — read draws in FILE order
To recover *what cels a scene draws + where* when you don't know the blit entry, watch the
**cel-pointer write** rather than a specific dispatch address. On this engine the blit source
pointer is ZP **`$03/$04`** (`$1A61` copies it to `$1B/$1C`, then `lda ($03),y` reads the
cel width/height header); position is **`$05`=col, `$06`=row**. A `wpset` on `$04` (hi byte)
with a `tracelog` of `wpdata`,`$03`,`$05`,`$06`,`pc` dumps the whole draw program:
```lua
cpu.debug:wpset(cpu.spaces["program"],"w",0x04,1,nil,
  'tracelog "cel=%02X%02X col=%02X row=%02X pc=%04X\\n",wpdata,b@0x03,b@0x05,b@0x06,pc; go')
```
Three gotchas that each cost a run in the climb-window investigation:
- **The climb blits through `$1AF1`/`$1A17`/`$B1B6`, NOT the `$1903`–`$190C` fight dispatch.**
  Tapping only the known fight entry returned ~0 draws (cf. `tap-every-draw-entry-not-just-the-first`).
  Watching the *pointer* is entry-agnostic — it catches every path.
- **Watching only the HIGH byte `$04` misses same-page cels** (a `$A3C5→$A3E9` step writes only
  `$03`). It still enumerates the page structure, but to pin the *first/start* cel, **read the
  draws in FILE (execution) order** over a window that starts *before* the phase — the first
  player-bank line is the start pose. (Frame-tagging by poking the frame# into text page `$0400`
  FAILED here — 0 draws — either perturbing state or all sampled frames were static holds; the
  reliable move was the wide continuous window + file-order, not per-frame tagging.)
- **Sparse-redraw scenes trap even sampling.** The climb redraws the whole tableau only at its
  ~5–6 step transitions and holds statically between; evenly-spaced frame samples (every 9f)
  land on static holds and capture *nothing*. A single continuous window spanning a transition
  captures the program; each cel's repeat-count then reads as static-vs-scroll (identical
  col/row across redraws = static; drifting row = scroll).

*Established:* climb-window investigation 2026-07-12 (climb tableau = `$AB` cliff bank +
`$AA`/`$A9`, static; start pose `$A3C5` Y158; HUD `$0B12` present player-side).

---

## 10c. Identify a scene by draw-program CONTENT, never by frame number (frame #s are boot-relative)
Frame numbers are **not comparable across runs** — the attract phase that lands at frame N
shifts run-to-run (disk/boot timing offsets the whole timeline). A prior capture set named
`scene6_climb_00_f6019` turned out to be **scene-5 (princess in cell)**: in that boot f6019
fell inside scene-5; in a fresh boot f6019 is the climb bottom-start. **Anchor every capture
to what the draw program draws, not to a frame label.** Mechanism:
- **Per-scene bank signatures.** Sweep a wide window with a **frame-tagged write-tap** on `$04`
  (idiom §10b + the tap-GC rule) whose Lua callback reads `scr:frame_number()` and buckets the
  first/last frame each cel *bank* appears. Distinct scenes = distinct banks:
  scene-5 princess = `$1CC4` shadow + `$1Dxx` figure; scene-6 climb = `$A3–$A6` pose + `$AB`
  cliff + `$AA` scenery. The boundary is where one bank set stops and the next starts (here:
  princess ends ~f5653, climb pose `$A3C5` starts f6018, with a `$96/$99` transition between).
- **Content-verify each snapshot, not its frame #.** A frame is the climb bottom-start iff its
  window draws `$A3C5`+`$AB` with the player low (`$06`=Y158) and **no** `$1Cxx` princess cel.
  `grep -c 'cel=1C'` over the capture window = 0 is the scene-5-excluded proof.
- **Find a phase's start/hold via a per-frame ZP read in the notifier.** The player climb-Y is
  ZP `$06`; reading it each frame shows it settle+hold at 158 (bottom-start held f6019–6058)
  then decrement as the crawl ascends — pins the "lowest/first" frame without pixel reads.
- **Name captures by content, keep the frame only as provenance.** `scene6_climbstart_00_bottom_Y158_f6030`
  — the tag is the verified content; `f6030` is a boot-local provenance stamp, not an anchor.
  Never reuse a sibling boot's frame label to name a new boot's capture.

*Established:* scene-6 climb re-capture 2026-07-13. Content-anchoring alone was necessary but
NOT sufficient — the deeper defect was a key-leak that put the emulator in a different SCENE
(see §10a ZERO-KEYBOARD): the windowed `$A3C5`/`$AB` "climb" was the actual-game fight. In the
CLEAN keyboard-off attract the real climb is a distinct SCENE Jay identified visually (hero
crawling then holding on `$8ACB` y124, my-boot ~f6068+) — and it SHARES banks with the fight and
the princess-fall, so bank signatures cannot separate them. Capture keyboard-off + gate visually;
never anchor a scene to bank signature alone or to a frame label from a windowed boot.

## Read the render MECHANISM per cel from execution (which routine), not from coordinates
When a scene won't reproduce by placing cels at `$05`/`$06` (Karateka wall-top, ~20 gate failures),
bp the render routines and see WHICH draws each cel — the mechanism differs per asset and dictates
the port primitive:
- `$1903`→`routine_1a42` = **standard sprite blit** (`$0900` vert-addr table + `L1A84` sub-byte).
- `$190C` = mirror blit. `$1BF4` = **masked-blit** (SMC blend opcode + `$0900` shift table).
- `$0A09` render_pass_a / `$0A40` render_pass_b = **pattern-fill** (single/dual-colour pixel fill).
And read the SCENE-SPRITE loader: `load_scene_sprite_ae3f` computes X = `$52`(scroll) ± `xadj[i]`
→ so `$05` is a scroll-relative COMPUTE, not the render column (the historical registration trap).
**Two gotchas:** (1) a cel firing at `$05`=`$FE` is parked OFF-SCREEN (e.g. combatants `AA23/AA31`
during the climb) — a traced cel is not necessarily visible; (2) labels lie — `AA23/AA31` were
called "wall-top posts" for the whole arc but the code draws them as the fight combatants; the real
wall-top is `$AA27–$AA30` via masked-blit at sub-byte shift 5. *Established:* wall-top identify

## A blit's source pointer WALKS the cel data — consecutive `$03` values are ROWS, not cels
When you trace a blit by its source pointer (`$03`/`$04`), the pointer **increments through the
cel's row data as it renders** — so a masked-blit reading a 12-row×1-byte cel logs `$03` =
`$AA25,$AA26,…,$AA30` (12 *consecutive* addresses, one per row). Read naively, that looks like
**"12 separate cels `$AA25–$AA30`"** — a PHANTOM. It is actually the **12 data bytes of ONE cel**
whose 2-byte header sits just below (`$AA23` = `0C 01` → h=12,w=1; data `$AA25`–`$AA30`). The tells:
- **Consecutive one-apart addresses** (`$AA25,26,27…`) are almost never distinct cels — cels are
  header+data blocks, not 1 byte apart. Distinct cels come from a *table* of pointers, not a walk.
- **`extract_cel(base)` returns garbage dims** (176×176) when `base` is mid-data, not a header.
  A real cel header gives small sane h/w. **Decode the header at the candidate base before believing
  a "cel range."** (`$AA25` gave 176×176 → not a header → `$AA25` is data, so back up to `$AA23`.)
- The write-pointer rows still decode correctly (rows 100–111 here) — they're just **the rows of
  one cel**, not one row each of twelve cels. Anchor = the cel's top row + its header dims.
This dissolved the entire "wall-top runner `$AA25–$AA30`" sub-arc: the wall-top is cels `$AA23` +
`$AA31` (already converted), masked at bytes 23 & 35, rows 100–111 — and the earlier "`$AA23`/`$AA31`
are spurious off-screen combatants" was a *second* draw-path confusion (shared-bank cel drawn both
off-screen as a combatant AND on-screen as the wall-top). *Established:* wall-top row/identity

## Enumerate the WHOLE setup window, not the one element you came for
When a static scene is wrong, don't trace only the suspect element — trace every render routine
from the beat's setup up to the FIRST character sprite (the animation boundary), enumerate the
full inventory (cel / HGR-pos / technique / order), then cross-check it against what the port
already draws. This arc chased "the wall-top" ~20× while TWO other setup elements were wrong: the
port drew `$AA23`/`$AA31` as scenery "posts" — but those are the fight COMBATANTS, parked
**off-screen (`$05`=`$FE`)** in the climb, so the port has spurious posts the oracle never draws;
and the cliff-face is the `$AB8E` cel-stack (std blit) vs the port's fill approximation. A single
completeness pass (missing / wrong-technique / mis-positioned / spurious) beats N one-element
fixes. *Established:* climb setup-inventory 2026-07-14. See `docs/project/climb-setup-inventory.md`.

## A cel-ID trace can be CONFIDENTLY WRONG repeatedly in one region — past scene 4, the eye wins
The scene-6 wall-top masked-blit trace produced **FOUR** cel-identification errors in one small region,
each stated with execution-evidence confidence: (1) `$AA23`/`$AA31` "= off-screen combatants" (they ARE
the wall-top); (2) `$AA25–$AA30` "= a 12-cel runner" (they're the **12 data rows of one cel `$AA23`** —
reading a cel's row data as separate cels); (3) `$96/$99` "= wall-top" (they're floor cels); (4) "only
**two** posts, the port's col-11 post is **spurious** — drop it" (there are **THREE** posts; the oracle
draws three; the port's third was correct — the "drop it" nearly deleted a correct shipped element).
**Jay's visual memory was right every time it disagreed with the trace.** The standing rule (past scene 4
the disassembly is complete-but-not-understood; running-game execution + the operator's eye are the
authority) earned its keep here: **when the eye and the trace disagree in this region, the eye wins, and
the trace gets FLAGGED unreliable-in-region — you do not "correct" a gated render toward the trace model.**
Mechanism hypothesis (INFERRED, not verified — do not investigate): a trace scoped to the masked path
`$1BF4` cannot see a **mirror blit `$190C`**; if the mirrored (leftmost) post draws via `$190C`, that
explains why the third post was invisible to the masked-only trace — and could matter for the combatants.

## 12. Capturing a specific oracle ANIMATION FRAME: content-anchor via the blit trampoline + the display-page status
When an operator says "the oracle doesn't draw X there," **capture that oracle frame per-pixel before
theorising a fix** — the eye is authority that it's wrong, but only the capture specifies what right is
(three anim_02-orange explanations died for lack of the target frame). Working recipe (validated on the
climb anim_02, `oracle_anim02_capture.lua`):
- **Content-anchor on the cel, not a frame number.** Read-tap the draw trampolines
  `$1903/$1906/$1909/$190C` (these DO fire — §7b), read `src=$04:$03`, `col=$05`, `row=$06`, and detect
  the pose's defining draw (anim_02 = legs `$A4A4` @ col `$0A` row `$8F`, the LAST part → pose complete).
  Install the taps **after boot settles** and keep them referenced (§2). The deterministic climb intro
  (§3) reliably reaches the pose (~f6084 my-boot; the run is ~170 emulated s at ≥2000% headless).
- **Dump the DISPLAYED HGR page, not a guessed one.** Karateka double-buffers HGR ($2000 page1 / $4000
  page2). Read **`$C01C` (RDPAGE2) — a NON-toggling status read**, bit7=1 ⇒ page2 displayed. Wait a few
  frames after the anchor for the page flip, then dump the displayed page (or dump both + record C01C).
- **For artifact COLOUR, take a `scr:snapshot()` with video ON** (drop `-video none` for this pass; RAM
  dumps alone can't give the NTSC artifact colour — HGR colour is an artifact of adjacent bits). The
  snapshot is 560×192 → halve to 280 native (`render_square --apple2e`), then reconcile onto the port
  with **CoCo3_px = Apple_px + 20** (state it) before any side-by-side. Held poses (7-VBL dwell) are
  stable, so the §6 "-nothrottle snapshots lie for motion" caveat doesn't bite a settled frame.
- **Read-only:** run against the oracle disk with the Lua living in the coco3 harness (absolute path);
  write outputs to a scratch dir (`-snapshot_directory`), never into the oracle repo.

## 12a. Log the ACTOR-POSITION var beside each draw — it makes a moving animation's ANCHOR readable
When capturing a **moving** animation's composition (the run, a walk — anything that translates),
the draw trace alone can't say what a part's column is measured *from*. **Add the actor-position ZP
to the per-draw line** (`$62` player / `$72` guard / `$52` scroll — the same fields
`recon1_drawprog.lua` logs) and check whether some part's `$05` **equals** it: in the run, legs
`$05` == `$62` in every steady-state pose ⇒ that part's `xadj` is 0 ⇒ **the frame origin IS the
player X**, measured rather than assumed. Then the other parts' offsets fall out as per-pairing
constants you can falsify: identical `(dx,dy)` on every recurrence across **independent** windows
(42 observations / 10 pairings / 0 contradictions), plus free geometry checks
(`row_torso + h_torso == row_legs` for all frames). **Also log `$10`** — X = `$05*7 + $10`, so a
sub-byte-only step (`$10` 1→6) moves the actor with `$05` unchanged; dropping `$10` silently
collapses distinct positions. Tool: `harness/tools/stageb0_run_capture.lua` (`RUN_ALL=1` = **no
filter — use this**; the bank filter exists only for a first readable sweep).

**⚠ DO NOT bank-filter the CAPTURE — §9's "wholesale bank exclusion hides actors sharing the bank"
applies to the capture script, not just to analysis excludes.** Filtering `stageb0_run_capture.lua`
to `$9B00-$9EB7` hid the **head `$8E9B`** (drawn in EVERY run pose, from the `$8E` bank) and hid the
run's **terminal standing pose** completely (it is `$899C`/`$8ACB`/`$8E9B` — no run-bank cel at all).
The filtered trace was **fully self-consistent** — 42 poses, invariant per-pairing offsets, a passing
`row_torso + h_torso == row_legs` check on every frame — so **no internal check could catch it**; the
operator's eye did. A capture-time filter is an irreversible commitment made when you understand the
scene least: **capture wide, filter at analysis** (a whole attract cycle unfiltered is ~3.4k lines —
readable). *Candidate:* `a-capture-filter-makes-absence-look-like-structure`.

## 13. Loop a scene SEGMENT via SAVE-STATE (live visual-comparison view)
To loop the oracle over ONE segment (e.g. climb→fight) instead of the whole natural attract loop (which
replays the full ~2-min intro each cycle): **save-state at the segment start, load-state at the segment end**
from a frame-notifier. `apple2e` **supports** save-states (`mame -listxml apple2e | grep savestate` →
`savestate="supported"` — many drivers are `unsupported`, so verify). The Lua API in **0.281**:
`manager.machine:save(name)` / `:load(name)` are real functions (`schedule_save`/`schedule_load` are **nil** —
use `:save`/`:load`); probe by printing `tostring(m.save)` in a 2-second `-seconds_to_run` script before relying on it.

**The loop** (frame-notifier state machine; tool `harness/tools/oracle_climb_fight_loop.lua`, canonical — copy
to the oracle repo `tools/` to run, §11):
```lua
local m = manager.machine; m.video.throttled = false            -- fast-forward the intro
local state, base = "ff", 0
_G._loop = emu.add_machine_frame_notifier(function()
  local fn = scr:frame_number()
  if state=="ff" then if fn>=FF then m:save("cf"); m.video.throttled=true; base=fn; state="play" end
  elseif state=="play" then if fn-base>=SEG then m:load("cf"); state="reanchor" end
  elseif state=="reanchor" then base=fn; state="play" end        -- re-anchor: frame_number RESETS to the
end)                                                             --   saved value after a load -> use a DELTA
```
`FF` = save/climb-start frame (~f5900–6018); `SEG` = frames start→reload (climb→fight ≈ 3500, before the natural
loop-back ~f9443). **Use the delta `fn-base`, NOT an absolute reload frame** — `frame_number` resets to the saved
value after `:load`.

**Windowed for viewing:** `mame apple2e -rompath <roms> -flop1 dumps/karateka.dsk -keyboardprovider none -window
-nomaximize -prescale 2 -resolution 1120x768 -script tools/oracle_climb_fight_loop.lua`. **`-keyboardprovider none`
is mandatory** (a focused windowed apple2e run leaks host keys → the disk loads the ACTUAL game, §10a). Launch in
the background; it never exits (close the window to quit).

**Property:** `:load` restores the exact machine state incl. the RNG seed → the loop replays the **identical**
segment each cycle (deterministic — good for a stable side-by-side reference). For VARIED fights, don't reload
(let the attract free-run) or perturb `$59` on reload. *Candidate:*

Lua API is MAME-general; coco3 supports save-states too — the port equivalent for a boot-excluded `.bin` is the
load-`.bin`+set-PC flow in `climb_live.lua`, a different mechanism.)*
